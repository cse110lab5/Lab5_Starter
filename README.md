## Pt3 Check Your Understanding
**Q1:** Unit testing would not be too useful here as there would be multiple parts and features that must work together to complete one operation. The unit tests would have to track a message that is sent and received by another user, which would be the interaction of two systems. 

**Q2:** Unit testing here would be useful as it is only testing an individual component, the max length of a message. This can be a simple cap imposed on the user and the component does not depend on other features to work, so a unit test will allow debugging on a small scale.
